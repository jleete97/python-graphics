Graphical experimentation in Python

## mover.py
Just move a triangular "ship" around the screen. The ship can go
north, south, east, or west, and needs a little work.

* Arrow keys change direction.
* 'C' changes color.
* ESC exits.

## gravity.py
Fly a triangular "ship" around the sun. The ship rotates in increments
of 10 degrees, and can thrust. The sun pulls you in if you don't orbit,
and you explode if you get too close.

* Left and right arrow keys to rotate.
* Up arrow thrusts forward.
* 'C' changes color.
* ESC exits.
